# API Key Maker

Using SHA1 encryption, it generates a random string to a set number of characters that is useful for API keys.  This is my attempt at creating my first gem.

## Installation
Add to your Gemfile and run the `bundle` command to install it.

```ruby
gem "api_key_maker", git: "https://github.com/codemis/api_key_maker"
```

**Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later.**

## Usage
Whenever you need to generator a key, just call the following method:

```ruby
ApiKeyMaker.make_api_key(10)
```
The first parameter tells what length you want the key to be.  It defaults to 10 characters, but can go up to 39 characters in length.

If you want an attribute of a model to default to an api_key, then just add the following in your model:
```ruby
make_api_key :api_token, 13
```

## Development
